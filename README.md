# Easybank_Landing_Page
This project involves creating a landing page for an imaginary bank using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and pure JS. The main purpose is to implement Tailwind and work with the Mobile-First paradigm for the first time. 
The Project has been created for only two screen sizes (Desktop Screen: 1440px & Mobile Screen: 376px) and work to make it responsive for all types of screens is still in progress.
